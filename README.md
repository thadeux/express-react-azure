# express-react-azure
second learning attempt

using this as a guide: https://vfeskov.com/2017/12/21/Create-React-App-with-Node-js-API-server-in-Docker/

Current goals:

* Express server for data api
* Use standard CRA app with proxy for webpack-dev-server
* node scripts running via npm to package server+client in production
* serve app out of azure; hopefully out of this same repo, but possibly out of another repo used exclusively for deployments
